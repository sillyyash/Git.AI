What We Built Today
1. Designed the Core Architecture ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Before writing any code, the entire project was designed as a modular system instead of a monolithic script.

AutoDevAI/
│
├── core/
│   ├── repository.py
│   ├── indexer.py
│   ├── graph.py
│   ├── parsers/
│   └── ai.py
│
├── agent/
├── prompts/
├── repos/
├── logs/
└── main.py

Each module was given a single responsibility, allowing every future feature to plug into the architecture without requiring major refactoring.

2. Built the Repository Scanner ✅

Created the first stage of the pipeline capable of recursively scanning an entire repository.

The scanner automatically:

Discovers every file
Detects programming language
Reads file contents
Stores metadata
Preserves directory structure

Example

Website/

index.html
style.css
script.js
auth.py
README.md

        │
        ▼

Repository Object

Files
Languages
Contents
Paths

This became the raw knowledge source for every later stage.

3. Built the Repository Indexer ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The Repository Scanner only reads files.

The Repository Indexer understands them.

For every file it extracts:

File size
Line count
Imports
Functions
Classes
Exports

Everything is stored inside structured Python dataclasses instead of loose dictionaries.

This created the project's first searchable repository database.

4. Built Language-specific Parsers ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Instead of treating repositories as plain text, AutoDevAI gained dedicated parsers for each supported language.

Python Parser

Extracts

Imports
Functions
Classes
JavaScript Parser

Extracts

Imports
Exports
Functions
Classes

Supports

JavaScript
TypeScript
React JSX
React TSX
HTML Parser

Parses

HTML
Embedded CSS
Embedded JavaScript

Extracts

HTML Elements
IDs
CSS Classes
JavaScript Functions
Imports

This allowed AutoDevAI to understand complete single-page websites.

CSS Parser

Extracts

Selectors
CSS Variables
Animations
Media Queries
IDs
Classes

Preparing the foundation for future styling intelligence.

5. Built Shared Parser Utilities

Rather than duplicating metadata logic across four parsers, a common parser utility layer was introduced.

Every parser now returns a consistent metadata schema, making downstream indexing and graph construction language-agnostic.

6. Built the Repository Graph ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This marked the transition from isolated files to interconnected repository knowledge.

Instead of storing symbols independently, AutoDevAI created indexes such as:

Function
     │
     ▼
   File

Class
     │
     ▼
   File

Selector
     │
     ▼
   File

Variable
     │
     ▼
   File

Import
     │
     ▼
   File

Reverse indexes were also introduced, allowing instant lookup of files referencing any symbol.

7. Built the Dependency Graph ⭐⭐⭐⭐

On top of the Repository Graph, a Dependency Graph was created.

It can answer questions like:

Which file defines this function?
Which files import this module?
Where is this class defined?
Which files depend on this module?

All through graph traversal—without requiring an LLM.

8. Fixed Duplicate Graph Relationships ✅

Discovered and resolved duplicate graph edges caused by repeated HTML elements.

Before

div
 │
 ├── index.html
 ├── index.html
 └── index.html

After

div
 │
 └── index.html

The graph now stores only unique relationships.

9. Built the Repository Inspector ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Created a professional inspection dashboard instead of dumping raw Python objects.

It reports:

Repository Summary
Total files
Total lines
Total size
Language distribution
Graph Summary
Functions
Classes
Selectors
Variables
Imports
Graph nodes
Graph edges
Repository Indexes
Function Index
Class Index
Selector Index
HTML IDs
CSS Variables
Animations
Import Graph
Reverse Import Graph

It also demonstrates live graph queries to verify correctness.

10. Connected the Local AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Integrated AutoDevAI with a locally running Ollama server.

Python

    │

    ▼

Ollama HTTP API

    │

    ▼

Qwen2.5-Coder 14B

    │

    ▼

AI Response

For the first time, AutoDevAI could send repository context directly to a local coding model.

What This Means

At the beginning of Day 1, AutoDevAI was only an idea.

By the end of the day, it could:

Scan complete repositories
Understand multiple programming languages
Extract repository structure
Build searchable indexes
Construct dependency graphs
Query repository knowledge without AI
Connect to a local LLM for reasoning

What We Built Today
1. Rebuilt the HTML & CSS Metadata Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

At the start of the day, the Repository Inspector reported:

Selectors      : 0
IDs            : 0
CSS Classes    : 0
Variables      : 0
Animations     : 0
Media Queries  : 0
Elements       : 0

The issue was traced through the entire pipeline.

HTML Parser
      │
      ▼
Repository Index
      │
      ▼
Dependency Graph
      │
      ▼
Inspector

The problem originated inside the parsers, not the inspector.

HTML Parser Improvements

Added extraction for:

HTML Elements
IDs
CSS Classes
External CSS
External JavaScript
Inline CSS
Inline JavaScript
CSS Parser Improvements

Major parser improvements included fixing:

Incorrect selector regex
Encoded SVG parsing
@keyframes
@media
Nested braces
Comments
Duplicate selectors

The regex-based implementation was replaced with a lightweight lexer that walks the stylesheet character by character, dramatically improving reliability.

2. Expanded the Repository Graph ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The Repository Graph evolved from storing only functions into a much richer representation.

Before

Functions
      │
      ▼
    Files

Now

Functions
Classes
Selectors
Variables
Animations
Media Queries
HTML Elements
IDs
CSS Classes
      │
      ▼
    Files

The repository now models far more than executable code.

3. Built the Relationship Graph ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This became the biggest architectural milestone of Day 2.

Instead of storing only indexes, AutoDevAI began storing semantic relationships.

Examples include:

HTML Element
      │
USES_CLASS
      ▼
CSS Class
HTML ID
      │
 USES_ID
      ▼
 CSS ID
CSS Selector
      │
 STYLES
      ▼
HTML Element
File
      │
IMPORTS
      ▼
Module

Future relationship placeholders were also added:

CALLS_FUNCTION
CALLS
REFERENCES
USES_CLASS (JavaScript)
DOM References

The graph now stores:

Source
Relationship
Target
Source File
Metadata

allowing semantic reasoning beyond simple indexes.

4. Upgraded the Repository Inspector ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The inspector now validates Relationship Graph construction.

It reports:

Total relationships
Relationship counts
Sample relationships
Relationship summaries

Including:

USES_CLASS
USES_ID
STYLES
IMPORTS
CALLS
REFERENCES
CALLS_FUNCTION

making relationship debugging straightforward.

5. Built the Public Query Engine ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

One of the most important architectural decisions of the project.

Instead of future AI agents interacting directly with graphs,

Dependency Graph

↓

Relationship Graph

↓

Indexes

↓

Manual Traversal

they now interact only with:

core/queries.py

Public APIs include:

find_html_for_selector()
find_elements_using_selector()
find_files_using_class()
find_style_chain()
find_functions_called_by()
find_call_chain()
find_import_chain()
find_all_dependencies()
find_related_files()

This permanently decouples the AI layer from graph implementation details.

Repository Output

Current relationship counts:

Total Relationships : 206

USES_CLASS      : 89
USES_ID         : 18
STYLES          : 98
IMPORTS         : 1
CALLS_FUNCTION  : 0
CALLS           : 0
REFERENCES      : 0

The remaining zeros were expected—they represented parser capabilities planned for Day 3.

Bugs Solved Today
✅ HTML parser now exposes elements, IDs, and CSS classes correctly.
✅ HTML parser integrates embedded CSS parsing.
✅ clean_metadata() correctly handles nested dictionaries.
✅ Duplicate metadata handling fixed.
✅ CSS selector extraction ignores encoded SVG data.
✅ Regex selector parsing replaced with a lexer.
✅ Consistent metadata naming (css_classes).
✅ Relationship Builder correctly produces STYLES relationships.

# What We Built Today

---

# 1. Upgraded Every Language Parser into a Static Analyzer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Today wasn't about adding more regex.

It was about making every parser understand relationships.

## JavaScript

We transformed the JavaScript parser into a real static analyzer.

It now detects

* Function Call Graph
* DOM References
* Event Listeners
* classList Operations
* Module Symbol Usage
* Object Method Calls

Examples

```javascript
login();
```

↓

```
CALLS_FUNCTION
```

---

```javascript
document.querySelector(".card")
```

↓

```
DOM Reference
```

---

```javascript
btn.addEventListener("click", save)
```

↓

```
EVENT_BINDS
```

---

```javascript
classList.add("active")
```

↓

```
MODIFIES_CLASS
```

---

```javascript
import { save } from "./db"
```

↓

```
Module Symbol Usage
```

The parser now resolves

* aliases
* destructuring
* namespace imports
* optional chaining
* chained method calls

instead of only extracting names.

---

## Python

The Python parser also became much smarter.

It now extracts

* Function Call Graph
* Class Inheritance
* Method Relationships
* Decorators
* Imported Symbol Usage

Instead of simply recording

```
class User
```

it now understands

```
User

↓

inherits

↓

BaseModel
```

and

```
User.login()

↓

calls

↓

User.load_profile()
```

---

## HTML

HTML now understands

* Inline Events
* Forms
* Semantic Attributes
* Assets

instead of only elements.

---

## CSS

CSS intelligence expanded with

* Variable Usage Graph
* Selector Specificity
* Pseudo Selectors
* Theme Detection

Instead of storing CSS,

it now understands CSS.

---

# 2. Repository Reasoning Layer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Until yesterday the project stored facts.

Today it started reasoning.

A completely new package was built:

```
core/reasoning/
```

Algorithms include

* Dead Code Detection
* Unused Imports
* Unused Exports
* Dependency Trees
* Reverse Dependency Trees
* Circular Dependency Detection
* Impact Analysis
* Architecture Rule Validation
* Feature Ownership
* Duplicate Utility Detection

Instead of asking

```
Where is login()?
```

the system can now answer

```
What breaks if I rename login()?
```

or

```
Which files are no longer used?
```

This is a huge architectural jump.

---

# 3. Repository Intelligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We added another entirely new layer.

```
core/intelligence.py
```

Instead of storing graph data,

it understands the repository.

It can now detect

* MVC Architecture
* React/Vue Components
* Express Routes
* Flask/FastAPI Endpoints
* Configuration Files
* Entry Points
* Build Systems
* Package Managers
* Testing Frameworks
* Deployment Files

It also generates

```
Repository Profile
```

which summarizes

* architecture
* frameworks
* languages
* project structure
* routes
* entry points
* major features

This becomes the executive summary for AI.

---

# 4. Public Query Engine became the AI SDK ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Yesterday it was mostly graph wrappers.

Today it became the official API for the AI.

New high-level queries include

```
search_symbol()

find_component()

find_references()

find_definitions()

find_owner()

dependency_tree()

impact_analysis()

find_dead_code()

build_repository_profile()

summarize_repository()

detect_project_structure()
```

The AI never touches

* graphs
* parsers
* reasoning
* intelligence

Everything flows through

```
core/queries.py
```

This abstraction is one of the most important architectural decisions so far.

---

# 5. Built the AI Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is the biggest feature of Day 3.

We separated the AI into clean layers.

---

## Context Builder

```
core/context_builder.py
```

Uses only

```
queries.*
```

It builds request-aware context including

* repository profile
* relevant symbols
* definitions
* references
* owners
* dependency tree
* impact analysis
* related files

It also adds

* relevance scoring
* keyword extraction
* caching
* context trimming
* token budgeting

---

## Prompt Builder

```
core/prompt_builder.py
```

Instead of concatenating strings,

it builds structured prompts.

Supports modes

* Planner
* Coder
* Reviewer
* Tester

Supports output formats

* Text
* Markdown
* JSON
* Patch
* Diff

It also reports prompt statistics.

---

## Model Layer

```
core/model.py
```

A production-grade Ollama client.

Features

* Model configuration
* Streaming
* Retries
* Timeout
* Health checks
* Model listing
* Chat API
* JSON generation
* Statistics
* Latency tracking
* Retry/backoff

Most importantly,

the AI no longer knows anything about Ollama.

Only the model layer does.

---

## AI Orchestrator

```
core/ai.py
```

Contains almost no business logic.

Pipeline

```
Request

↓

Context Builder

↓

Prompt Builder

↓

Model

↓

Response
```

Exactly how it should be.

---

# 6. Added AI Debugging & Logging ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A completely new debugging layer was added.

```
core/logger.py
```

The AI now supports

```
debug=True
```

which exposes

* Context
* Prompt
* Prompt Statistics
* Model Statistics
* Response Metadata

It also supports request logging

```
logs/

↓

timestamp.json
```

Every request can now be replayed and analyzed later.

This will be invaluable when debugging future AI agents.

---

# 7. Massive Architectural Cleanup

One of today's biggest achievements wasn't new features—

it was enforcing clean boundaries.

The architecture now follows a strict separation of concerns.

```
Repository

↓

Parsers

↓

Repository Index

↓

Dependency Graph

↓

Relationship Graph

↓

Reasoning

↓

Intelligence

↓

Queries

↓

Context Builder

↓

Prompt Builder

↓

Model

↓

AI
```

Each layer has exactly one responsibility.

That makes future development significantly easier.

# Where AutoDevAI Stands After Day 3 

By the end of Day 3, AutoDevAI is no longer just a repository inspector. It has evolved into a layered AI platform capable of understanding a codebase, reasoning about relationships and dependencies, summarizing architecture, retrieving only relevant context, constructing optimized prompts, interacting with a language model through a provider abstraction, and tracing every AI request through structured logging and debugging. The next milestone—**the Planner Agent**—will be the first component that uses this entire foundation to make autonomous engineering decisions rather than simply answering questions.

What We Built Today
1. Built the Planner Agent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The biggest milestone of Day 4 was introducing the first autonomous AI agent.

Instead of simply answering repository questions, AutoDevAI can now generate an execution plan for engineering work.

The Planner now produces structured plans containing

Intent Classification
Repository Impact Analysis
Dependency Analysis
Risk Assessment
Complexity Estimation
Repository Profile
Ordered Execution Steps
Validation Steps
Alternative Approaches
Warnings
Missing Information
Clarification Questions

Example request

Create multiply(a,b) in math.py

becomes

Intent

↓

Affected Files

↓

Dependencies

↓

Execution Steps

↓

Validation

↓

Ready for Coder

Rather than free-form text, the Planner produces structured data that downstream agents can execute.

2. Execution Plan System ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

A dedicated planning model was introduced.

Every task is decomposed into ordered execution steps.

Example

Locate Symbols

↓

Analyze Dependencies

↓

Create Function

↓

Run Tests

↓

Review Code

↓

Commit Changes

Each step contains

unique id
execution order
responsible agent
affected files
affected symbols
dependencies
validation criteria

The Planner became the orchestration layer for future AI agents.

3. Built the Coder Agent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The second major achievement was building the first implementation of the Coder Agent.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, the Coder never edits files directly.

Its responsibility is only to generate repository changes.

Model

↓

Structured Change Objects

The Coder never

modifies files
writes patches
performs Git operations
updates indexes

Those responsibilities remain separate pipeline stages.

4. Introduced Structured Change Objects ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

One of the largest architectural improvements today was replacing free-form code generation with structured repository edits.

Each generated change contains

path

operation

reason

start_line

end_line

content

target_path

symbol

metadata

Supported operations include

insert_before

insert_after

replace_range

delete_range

create_file

delete_file

move_symbol

rename_symbol

update_import

This creates a stable interface between AI generation and repository modification.

5. Designed the AI Change Contract ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Instead of allowing arbitrary LLM output, the Coder now enforces a strict JSON schema.

The model must return

status

summary

warnings

errors

changes[]

Every change is validated before it leaves the Coder.

Malformed responses are rejected immediately.

This significantly improves reliability for downstream automation.

6. Built the First AI Validation Layer ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The Coder now performs internal validation before passing work downstream.

Validation includes

JSON parsing
Operation validation
Region validation
Semantic requirement validation
Required field validation
Line range validation

Invalid responses never reach the Patch Generator.

7. Built Repository-Aware Prompt Generation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The Coder now generates highly structured prompts.

Each prompt includes

Repository Profile

↓

Planner Context

↓

Execution Step

↓

Affected Files

↓

Numbered Source Code

↓

Operation Guide

↓

Output Contract

Rather than asking the model to rewrite files,

the model receives only the information required for the current execution step.

8. Repository Context Became Line-Aware ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Existing source files are now injected into prompts with numbered lines.

Example

1    def add(a, b):
2        return a + b

This enables precise region-based edits rather than full-file rewrites.

The Coder can now reference exact locations inside a file.

9. End-to-End Planner → Coder Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Today marked the first successful autonomous pipeline.

Structured Change Objects

The system successfully generated minimal repository edits without modifying the repository itself.

This validates the overall architecture before implementing the Patch Generator.

Where AutoDevAI Stands After Day 4

By the end of Day 4, AutoDevAI crossed an important architectural milestone. The project is no longer limited to understanding and reasoning about a repository—it can now plan engineering work and generate structured repository modifications. The Planner Agent converts natural language requests into ordered execution plans, while the Coder Agent transforms those plans into validated, minimal Change objects instead of directly editing source code. This establishes the first autonomous AI development pipeline built on top of the repository intelligence created during the previous days. The next milestone—the Patch Generator—will convert these structured Change objects into actual repository modifications, followed by validation, repository writing, testing, review, and Git automation, completing the end-to-end autonomous software engineering workflow.
